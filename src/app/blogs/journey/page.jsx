        My place in technology, in software engineering, was always selected I
        believe long before I ever knew what coding was, what it could achieve
        and the dominance it has in all our lives. I always felt like I was
        unique in that I was not easily influenced, you could not bully me into
        jamming to the latest songs by mega artists, don clothes like how all
        the youth dress today, or even do the many things that are classed as
        normal by most people. I am not painting myself to be righteous or
        anything special really, I just have never felt the need to do what is
        popular, fun and appealing by all accounts.

      <p className="mb-[19px] ">
        Not doing the popular thing, in many cases the good if not better thing,
        really hurt me in one area of life - my career. At no point 
        have I had my mind set on a career. Forget about knowing what I wanted
        to do, I did not know the many jobs and careers that existed, apart from
        the very mainstream ones, like lawyer, teacher, police officer etc. Nor
        did I ever care ,to be honest, to find out for myself. I had a laptop, a
        phone like everyone else, a few taps and I would have had videos,
        articles, blogs on every job on the planet, and better than that, a
        guide on how to get those jobs no matter how skilled or unskilled you
        were. But a career, a job, a living, was not something I had at the
        front of mind. I’ll go one step further, it wasn't something I ever
        really thought about despite running into that question a few times in
        years gone past, especially during the last year of university and sixth
        form.

        Apart of me just thought good academics would mean that I could in the
        end do what I wanted. But that was not really true. I never once thought
        my options were any less when I flunked an exam, or achieved a mark less
        than the highest scorer in the class. I think the analogy that best
        describes my approach (I use that word very lightly) is that I was like
        a bot, like a chatbot, who could answer any question relating to one
        topic and give you the answers in a million and one ways, but when it
        came to something I was not trained on, I just could not help you.

        I graduated from Warwick, with a law degree. A 2:1 in fact. Law meant
        nothing to me before university, it meant nothing to me during the
        three-year-long course and it means nothing to me today. I have zero
        love for it. It does not mean I hate it. But if you ask me to dedicate a
        career, a life to the legal industry, given the option I would have to
        say no. And I say that because I was being asked that very question,
        fortunately enough. I needed that. Had I been sitting on a training
        contract at a magic circle firm or had a sponsor to cover the SQE fees,
        I would have gone back on auto-pilot, and just continued on with my
        life, and who knows where I would be today.

        One thing I have always loved is technology. I do not know why frankly,
        but you can kinda say I was born with it. Problem was, as a kid, I just
        thought that you had to be a Steve Jobs, or a Zuckenburg, a designer or
        creator of a technology to work in it, and so you had to have this one
        in a billion IQ, which unfortunately I do not think I had or even have
        today.

        Luckily that was not true. I will spare you all the details from finding
        that out to enrolling on a bootcamp. The coding bootcamp was insane,
        literally life-changing. I felt at home. I had never felt that relaxed
        or happy learning before. So I finished that, learned a bunch of things,
        like the technologies for web development. And I also did that in a
        group setting, so it was nice building and learning alongside others,
        something that was deprived from me because of COVID, or was that an
        excuse by the universities to have lessons online….nevermind.

        “You will get a job as long as you keep applying, that is for sure”.
        Sounds like simple advice. But the reality is a lot more layered. You do
        not suddenly become more favoured when you reach 100 applications or
        200. You can do as many calculators, or to-do applications you want,
        that simply won’t impress anybody in the industry enough to take a
        chance on you. I realised that when I properly realised that many others
        were applying for the same position. These many others have more years
        on me. And more importantly a lot of them have the experience in a
        commercial environment, working on real applications used by real
        people. And those that were not so lucky to have that on their CV, have
        gone to university and studied Computer Science and have learned the
        theory, and that counts for something apparently. In other words, simply
        doing a bootcamp and having the skills puts you at the bottom of the
        totem pole, literally no one has less experience than you. In other
        words, you do not win a contest with anybody, draw you might, but not
        win. Yes, experience in another industry is worth something at least,
        but that I do not have.

        I had this idea whilst sitting not so comfortably at some Amazon depot,
        doing a test to assess my readiness to drive their Amazon vans around to
        bring parcels to many empty or deadly dog-ridden homes. That idea was
        Playpal. I have produced Playpal, truly unique , truly usable and truly
        problem-solving. The problem it solves, it helps you create a network of
        friends to play football without having to create that network for
        yourself. The app lists all the fields within a 2 mile radius of your
        location and gives you the ability to declare your interest in going.
        Anyone within your area ,once logged in, can see and from there, can
        message you and plan to go and enjoy a game of football. Now the app
        notifies anyone in the area that you are at the park. Again, someone
        might see that and go because they know there is someone to play with. A
        simple trend, but a super healthy and enjoyable one. I might come back
        to this to tell you a bit more, or write a second part in another blog,
        but in the meanwhile, check the app out through the projects page. Love for
        the love....
