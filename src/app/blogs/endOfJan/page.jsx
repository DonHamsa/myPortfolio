        As I was writing my last few of blogs I realised that I was veering back into
        my university days, just researching and learning for the sake of an
        exam. What does this mean? It means that I want to really understand a
        topic well enough before I pass judgment, before I rip into the
        wrongdoers and empathise with the wronged. Writing the last post about
        politics was the turning point. I think I know a decent amount about
        politics, a decent amount of economics without studying it academically.
        But I feel like I know just enough to score well in an exam but not
        enough to justifiably take a stance and not pass generic, second-hand
        opinions.

        So I have signed up for a Financial Markets course. I really want to
        level up my knowledge of finance. I know a bit. But a bit is not a lot.
        Not enough to feel comfortable to debate. I really want to know the work
        that asset managers get involved in, what someone working in the debt
        capital market gets up to, and the realities of the work people in
        finance at the likes of Canary Wharf do. I am going to be honest with
        you. I love technology. But I feel like the best scenario would have
        been to experience working in both industries, and choosing what I like
        best. I still think technology comes out on top, but I am in no position
        to be authoritative about that opinion. It is like a poor man telling
        you of all the perils of having money.

        I am also currently reading Politics on the Edge by Rory Stewart and
        that book really is something. The inner workings of parliament one could
        imagine to be full of stabbing, back-chatting and betrayal. But to
        actually read about these things is truly astonishing. Boris Johnsonâ€™s
        media interviews and talks are not fake, they are not acts or a facade
        to win votes on character and personality. He is truly like that in the
        cabinet and in his roles. And my opinion of really considering reforming
        our parliamentary system has also only strengthened. As Rory stated, no
        MP really knows the details of their portfolio. You could be minister of
        the Police and Probation Service and really not know a thing, and the
        same goes for every department in government. The civil service takes
        full reign and you are there to show face and toe the party line. I am
        almost finished and this book has really grown on me, it makes my
        opinion on politics feel truer, that politics does not make sense.
