        I feel like shit right now. I wonder what it must feel like to lose
        someone you really love or care about.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        After a few weeks of putting all my effort and energy and hope really
        into getting a place at Version 1, I got the email of rejection. It
        hurt. It stung. I felt defeated. Your mind goes everywhere. Where did I
        fall short? Two things were happening in my mind. First, I felt like I
        lost my pride, my ego and self-confidence. To be deemed to be a weaker
        candidate did not feel good. But after a few seconds of zoning-out, it
        was the 'how could I have done better' question that repeated a billion
        and one times in my head. The problem is without feedback, I won't be
        satisfied with the answer. I would drive myself psycho before arriving
        at a final conclusion.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        The path forward looks less brighter than it did a few days ago. But I
        wait. I wait for the feedback to improve. To pick myself up, dust my
        self down and come back a stronger and more improved candidate. And if I
        fall back again, I repeat. Repeat and then repeat again.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        It is not the right time to be in deep thought about the activities. I
        thought I asked good questions. Questions that were the result of hours
        of research into the company and whose answers were not available
        anywhere but from those who worked and walked the halls of the offices.
        The Lego activity I guess is where I underperformed. But to guess is
        pointless. I just have to wait to hear the feedback and action on it for
        a next time.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        Now I am really tempted to open a can of worms and explore what 'the
        next time' means and talk about companies' hiring practices, the current
        flatlining tech market, the trend toward a tech career to leave behind
        what always seems to be a 'boring', 'unstimulating' previous job. But I
        cannot really be asked to focus on that. I think people have a habit of
        glamourising the past. I'm sure there was a high level of difficulty in
        the past in securing a job in tech or elsewhere really.

        So the race continues, the competition is on. It is on me to win, and
        there are many battles ahead to prove myself. For now I failed, I was
        poor and not good enough. But the beauty of life is that you get a chance to be
        victorious every second of every day until your last, dying breath.
