        Apple is one of the biggest companies in the world. There are many
        companies that turn over billions and billions quarterly with CEOs on
        extraordinary salaries. But who they are and what they do is anybody’s
        guess. These companies are only really known to a handful of people.
        Take TSMC for example. How many people know the role TSMC plays in our
        lives, how important they are to our existence and the apocalyptic
        future without them. I would suggest not many. But Apple is different.
        Their products are in almost every home in the western world. They are
        big. Not only in the sense that they are the second or third largest
        company by market cap in the world but big enough so that people buy
        from them assuming good, solid, quality products without considering the
        opportunity cost.

      <h2 className="font-bold mb-[5px] text-[16px] ">Why I was anti-apple? </h2>

      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        I was not just being a contrarian, thinking everybody likes Apple so I
        will not. I had my own reasons. I first saw Apple as a phone
        manufacturer, a company that designs and produces phones. If I looked at
        their phones in isolation without having anything to compare it to, I
        had nothing to complain about. This was during the time of giant leaps
        in telecommunication technology, social media apps and streaming
        services like Netflix.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        But when I got introduced to products that came from Sony, or Samsung or
        LG, I started to ask questions. Why am I allowed to do so much more on
        these devices? Why am I given a wider range of applications? Why are the
        year to year changes so much more drastic and unexpecting than Apple’s
        improving but moderately different phones. I also took offense to the
        pricing, why were their products always more expensive than everybody
        else’s. Without really caring so much for the underlying benchmark
        numbers, both phones looked to be as performant in the youtube videos
        that I watched, Samsung’s phones did not freeze or lag at every touch
        like how it was reported at the time.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        Now what mattered to me was personality and choice, will you let me do
        what I want to my device all the way from installing a custom ROM to
        simply moving an icon on the home screen from right to left. Apple’s
        Iphone, like with all their products, did not. They chose what you could
        and could not do with your devices. It dates all the way back to the
        founder Steve Jobs, and his philosophy of controlling the user
        experience, although he would probably change the word controlling to
        something more positive. He would probably see himself as an artist,
        creating this wonderful piece that is the result of care , skill and
        love, and any unconsenting additions destroys and changes the thing all
        together. He believed that closing the system from excessive
        customisation both at the hardware and software level meant that the
        user was squeezing every last bit of juice from the product, and any
        idea of trying to make it ‘better’ was an insult not only to Apple but
        himself.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        I was not really rebellious in any other part of my life. I usually
        deferred to the expertise of my teachers. I never really liked questions
        that asked for suggestions or reform on settled issues, if smarter,
        brighter minds all thought this is best and most acceptable way of doing
        things, why change it? But I sort of loosened up when it came to
        opinions and beliefs in technology, not caring for what was the popular
        opinion or the words spoken of the supposed expert, if I thought you
        were wrong, you were wrong.
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-bold mb-[5px] text-[16px] ">The change</h2>
      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        My opinions of Apple changed in the last few months to a year lets say.
        Yes, reading Steve Jobs autobiography did make me like the man. Heck, I
        made him my desktop wallpaper 4 months ago and he is still there. I
        change my wallpaper every month or so, sometimes ever more frequently,
        but I guess I have become a fan, some would sadly add a boy to the end
        of that.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        No gimmicks. Excellent build quality. Consistency. Seamless Integration.
        Apple is a lot more than that, but those descriptions are exactly what I
        look for now when making buying decisions. My shit Samsung Galaxy book 4
        edge.... Not shit , that would just be a lie, an exaggeration. But what
        makes me angry is how Samsung and all the other laptops in the new
        Qualcomm-powered family range marketed their products. I have no
        background in computer science. I did not know about registers, memory
        buses, arithmetic units before I found out about ARM and x86. (Just a
        little brag, I kind of do now having read <span className="italic">Code: The Hidden Language of
        Computer Hardware and Software </span> by <span className="italic">Charles Petzold</span>).
      </p>
      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        I just learned that ARM means better battery performance without any
        compromise on performance. So I went with Samsung. Weird thing but great
        at the time ,and still today,was that the product ON LAUNCH was 300
        pounds off paired with free galaxy buds. Remember all those nice words
        about Apple I had used earlier. Add strong and firm to that. I have
        never seen an Apple device on discount. They believe that their price
        stands for something, is a representation of what you will get when you
        open the box and peel the plastic. The best product should also mean the
        most expensive in their eyes. (If you are a regular visitor of the
        financial times or pay attention to the news with a keen eye, you are
        probably thinking I made a mistake, not acknowledging that Apple’s
        Iphone is on sale in China right now. Yes, I have seen that and yes it
        did surprise me, but China’s ability to undercut the market in so many
        industries proves that you have to get good at their game. Why should
        Apple not adapt? Am I fanboying, doing too much now?)
      </p>
      <p className="mb-[19px]">
        The promised battery performance of my laptop is 20 hours. So why did my
        laptop drain 19 percent yesterday from just casual browsing on the
        browser alongside an open slack application that was idly in the
        background. And why is it better at times, managing to only zap 10
        percent. Annoying, right? When I get a job, how am I going to be able to
        judge how long the laptop will last, will I always have to bring the
        charger with me, untrusting of how quick or slow the battery drain will
        be?
      </p>
      <p className="pb-[19px]">
        In short, what I am trying to say is Apple stands for something. They
        are proud. They see themselves above any one else, snobbish. But please
        do not change. At least I know what they are. I can therefore make
        informed decisions. No wolf in sheep clothing. I do not want to get
        political but would you rather live in a supposed democracy that
        operates prisons where prisoners are tortured to death, subjected to the
        evilest of treatments, keeping people without trial for decades whilst they
        claim to be the home of free speech. Or live in a dictatorship where the
        line is drawn in thick black ink, and the rules are clear. I don’t know,
        do you?
